Organism's traits:

Speed
Dimension
Food detection range (Food Radar) 
Temperature sensibility (It depends on an organism's dimension). 

(1) Speed 
Speed is a trait that allows him to advance multiple positions at the same time.
The higher the speed the higher the food consumption.

(2) Dimension
Dimension is a trait that allows determining how much food the organism can eat.
An organism with a higher dimension could eat more but it will consume more energy.
Dimension affect also temperature sensibility.
The higher the dimension the higher the food consumption.

(3) Food detection range (Food Radar) 
It's a trait that allows the organism to detect food all around him.
The higher the radius the higher the food consumption.

(4) Temperature sensibility.
It's affected by the organism's dimension.
A big organism will resist better to cold and it will suffer higher temperature.
Instead, a small organism will resist better to hot and it will suffer slower temperature.

Organism varies its representation depending on its traits' value.
Dimension: the organism radius is directly proportional to its dimension.
Speed (Red), Food Radar(Brown) e Children Quantity(Violet) they influence the color, in particular: the lower the value of the trait, the more they will affect with a light shade of the associated color; instead the more the value increases and the more the tonality becomes darker.

It is possible to choose some initial values ​​of the simulation from the menu, after which clicking on Start will open the simulation.
(*) Food Quantity: Quantity of food available in the environment. 
(*) Food Variation: Food daily variation.
(*) Initial Quantity: Organism initial quantity.
(*) Temperature: Environment temperature. 
(*) Dimension: Organism initial dimension. 
(*) Speed: Organism initial dimension.

In the simulation there are three buttons: Start / Stop, Back, Settings, the first allows you to pause and resume the simulation, the second allows you to return to the main menu, the third allows you to go to the settings.
